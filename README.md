# Ruleby-NG :: The Next Generation Rule Engine for Ruby

Ruleby-NG is a rule engine written in the Ruby language. It is a system for executing a set 
of IF-THEN statements known as production rules. These rules are matched to objects using 
the forward chaining Rete algorithm. Ruleby-NG provides an internal Domain Specific Language 
(DSL) for building the productions that make up a Ruleby-NG program.

Ruleby-NG is based on Ruleby.
